Make sure you have Node installed (I used 18.x)
Run the following command to execute any of the exercises:
```
node ~/whatever_your_path_is/Advent/Day X/partY.js
```

Note: For the first three days I saved the input as JSON files to make importing super easy. I changed the approach on day 4 because it seemed easier to just leave that one as a text file than to transform into a legal json structure.
